# OpenClaw Security Checklist

## Critical Version Requirement

**Minimum safe version: v2026.2.12**

Run `openclaw status` to check your version. If you are on anything older than v2026.2.12, upgrade immediately:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Known Critical Vulnerabilities

#### v2026.1.29 Patches (January 30, 2026)

| CVE | Severity | Description | Fixed In |
|-----|----------|-------------|----------|
| CVE-2026-25253 | **Critical (CVSS 8.8)** | One-click RCE: visiting a malicious site or clicking a crafted link leaks the gateway auth token, giving attackers full gateway control | v2026.1.29 |
| CVE-2026-24763 | High | Command injection via crafted input | v2026.1.29 |
| CVE-2026-25157 | High | Command injection via crafted input | v2026.1.29 |

#### v2026.2.12 Emergency Patch (February 12, 2026)

Over 40 security vulnerabilities patched in a single emergency release:

| CVE | Severity | Description | Fixed In |
|-----|----------|-------------|----------|
| CVE-2026-26322 | **High (CVSS 7.6)** | SSRF in Gateway tool — explicit deny policies and hostname allowlists added | v2026.2.12 |
| CVE-2026-26319 | **High (CVSS 7.5)** | Missing Telnyx webhook authentication | v2026.2.12 |
| CVE-2026-26329 | High | Path traversal in browser upload | v2026.2.12 |

Additional v2026.2.12 hardening:
- SSRF protection: explicit deny policies and hostname allowlists
- Path traversal prevention: skill sync limited to `skills/` root directory
- Prompt injection mitigation: browser/web content shifted to "untrusted by default"
- Transcript compaction now strips detailed tool results to reduce prompt injection replay risk

**Breaking change:** POST `/hooks/agent` rejects `sessionKey` overrides by default.

#### Post-v2026.2.12 CVEs (February 2026)

| CVE | Severity | Description | Fixed In |
|-----|----------|-------------|----------|
| CVE-2026-27001 | High | Workspace path embedded into prompts without sanitization (prompt injection risk) | v2026.2.19 |
| CVE-2026-27004 | High | Session transcript content could leak across peer sessions in multi-user environments | v2026.2.19 |
| CVE-2026-27484 | High | Discord moderation authorization bypass: non-admin users could spoof sender identity | v2026.2.19 |
| CVE-2026-27485 | Medium | Symlink handling in local skill packaging could disclose local files | v2026.2.19 |
| CVE-2026-27488 | High | Cron webhook delivery SSRF: webhook targets could reach private/internal endpoints | v2026.2.19 |
| CVE-2026-27576 | Medium | ACP prompt-size checks missing in local stdio bridge | v2026.2.19 |

A January 2026 audit identified 512 total vulnerabilities (8 critical). Over 70 additional security fixes were released across v2026.2.12 and v2026.2.19.

**Government advisories:**
- Belgium's Centre for Cybersecurity issued an emergency advisory classifying CVE-2026-25253 as critical
- The Dutch Data Protection Authority warned about serious cybersecurity and privacy risks and estimated ~20% of available plugins may contain malware
- Meta banned OpenClaw over security concerns

### Breaking Change: `auth: "none"` Permanently Removed

As of v2026.1.29, `gateway.auth.mode: "none"` is no longer accepted. All gateways require authentication. If you had `"none"` in your config, the gateway will refuse to start. Fix:

```bash
openclaw config set gateway.auth.mode token
openclaw config set gateway.auth.token "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Anthropic OAuth Tokens Blocked

Anthropic has officially blocked OpenClaw from using Claude OAuth tokens. You must use direct API keys:

```bash
# This will NOT work:
openclaw models auth  # OAuth flow for Anthropic is blocked

# Use API keys directly instead:
openclaw models auth setup-token --provider anthropic
# Then paste your API key from console.anthropic.com
```

## Quick Audit

```bash
openclaw security audit --deep
```

## Critical Settings

### 1. Gateway Binding
```bash
# Check current binding
openclaw config get gateway.bind

# Secure: Local only (default)
openclaw config set gateway.bind loopback

# Less secure: LAN access
openclaw config set gateway.bind 0.0.0.0  # NOT recommended
```

**Recommendation:** Keep `loopback` unless you need remote access. Use Tailscale for secure remote access.

### 2. Authentication Mode
```bash
# Use token auth (secure)
openclaw config set gateway.auth.mode token

# Generate strong token
openclaw config set gateway.auth.token "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
```

**Alternative: Trusted reverse proxy**
```bash
openclaw config set gateway.auth.mode trusted-proxy
# Requires an authenticated reverse proxy with TLS in front of the gateway
```

### 2b. Exec Approval Layer 2 (v2026.2.24+)

If agents still ask for exec approval after allowlists are correct, check the
second policy layer as well:

```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "security": "full",
    "ask": "off",
    "askFallback": "full"
  }
}
```

And verify the runtime config:

```bash
openclaw config set tools.exec.security full
openclaw config set tools.exec.strictInlineEval false
openclaw gateway restart
```

See the troubleshooting guide for the full failure mode and diagnostics.

### 3. Tailscale Authentication

When `gateway.auth.allowTailscale` is enabled, OpenClaw verifies identity headers (`tailscale-user-login`) by resolving the client IP through the local Tailscale daemon:

```bash
openclaw config set gateway.auth.allowTailscale true
```

This allows secure remote access without exposing the gateway to the public internet. Tailscale nodes are verified against the local daemon rather than trusting headers blindly.

### 4. DM Policy
```bash
# Check current policy
openclaw config get channels.<channel>.dmPolicy

# Secure: Require pairing (default)
openclaw config set channels.slack.dmPolicy pairing

# Alternative: Allowlist only
openclaw config set channels.slack.dmPolicy allowlist
openclaw config set channels.slack.allowFrom '["U12345678"]'
```

**Never use `open` policy without understanding the risks.**

### 5. Group Policy
```bash
# Secure: Allowlist only
openclaw config set channels.slack.groupPolicy allowlist

# Require mentions in groups
openclaw config set channels.slack.requireMention true
```

### 6. Sandbox Mode

OpenClaw supports three workspace access levels:

| Level | Mount | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `none` | Inaccessible | Agent cannot access workspace |
| `ro` | `/agent` (read-only) | Agent can read but not write |
| `rw` | `/workspace` (read/write) | Agent has full workspace access |

Sandbox scope options:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `agent` | Per-agent container (recommended) |
| `session` | Per-session container |
| `shared` | Single container for all (NOT recommended) |

```bash
# Enable sandboxing for all sessions
openclaw config set agents.defaults.sandbox.mode all

# Restrict workspace access
openclaw config set agents.defaults.sandbox.workspaceAccess none

# Set sandbox scope
openclaw config set agents.defaults.sandbox.scope agent
```

### 7. Control Plane Tool Denials

In production, deny high-risk tools that allow agents to modify the gateway itself:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "tools": {
        "deny": ["gateway", "cron", "sessions_spawn", "sessions_send"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Also restrict elevated tools (`exec`, `browser`, `web_fetch`, `web_search`) to trusted agents or use tool allowlists:

```bash
openclaw config set agents.defaults.tools.deny '["gateway","cron","sessions_spawn","sessions_send"]'
```

### 8. mDNS Discovery

OpenClaw can broadcast gateway presence via mDNS. Three modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `minimal` | Recommended. Omits `cliPath` and `sshPort` |
| `off` | Disabled entirely |
| `full` | Includes operational details (NOT recommended) |

```bash
# Set minimal mode (recommended)
openclaw config set gateway.mdns.mode minimal

# Or disable entirely
openclaw config set gateway.mdns.mode off

# Alternatively, disable via environment variable
export OPENCLAW_DISABLE_BONJOUR=1
```

### 9. Model Selection

Use modern, instruction-hardened models for bots with tool access:

- **Anthropic Opus 4.6**: Recommended for strong prompt injection resistance and tool safety
- **Anthropic Sonnet 4.6**: Good balance of capability and speed
- Avoid older or weaker models for tool-enabled agents facing untrusted inboxes

```bash
openclaw config set agents.defaults.model "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6"
```

### 10. Multi-User Trust Heuristic (v2026.2.24+)

Detects likely shared-user ingress and flags potential multi-user abuse on single-user channels:

```bash
openclaw config set security.trust_model.multi_user_heuristic true
```

### 11. HTTP Security Headers (v2026.2.23+)

When exposing the gateway over direct HTTPS (no reverse proxy), enable Strict-Transport-Security:

```bash
openclaw config set gateway.security.hsts true
```

## File Permissions

### Check Permissions
```bash
ls -la ~/.openclaw
```

### Fix Permissions
```bash
# Config directory: owner only
chmod 700 ~/.openclaw

# Config file: owner read/write only
chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json

# Credentials: owner only
chmod -R 600 ~/.openclaw/credentials/
```

Use full-disk encryption on the gateway host for an additional layer of protection.

{
  "gateway": {
    "bind": "loopback",
    "auth": {
      "mode": "token"
    },
    "mdns": {
      "mode": "minimal"
    }
  },
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "dmPolicy": "pairing",
      "groupPolicy": "disabled"

    "slack": {
      "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
      "allowFrom": ["U12345", "U67890"],
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
      "groups": ["C11111"],
      "requireMention": true
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6",
      "sandbox": {
        "mode": "all",
        "workspaceAccess": "none",

}
```

## Threat Model

### What OpenClaw Can Do
- Execute shell commands
- Read/write files
- Access network
- Send messages on your behalf
- Browse the web
- Spawn sub-agents (configurable depth)

### Attack Vectors
1. **Prompt Injection** - Malicious content in messages
2. **Social Engineering** - Tricking bot into harmful actions
3. **Credential Theft** - Accessing stored credentials
4. **Session Hijacking** - Cross-user context leakage
5. **Malicious Plugins/Skills** - ~20% of third-party plugins may contain malware (Dutch DPA estimate). The ClawHavoc campaign distributed 1,184+ malicious ClawHub skills carrying Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS) and Windows infostealers
6. **Token Leakage** - CVE-2026-25253 demonstrated gateway token exfiltration via crafted links
7. **SSRF** - CVE-2026-26322 and CVE-2026-27488 showed gateway and cron webhook SSRF reaching internal endpoints
8. **Session Leakage** - CVE-2026-27004 demonstrated transcript content leaking across peer sessions in multi-user setups

### Mitigations
- Keep OpenClaw updated to latest version (minimum v2026.2.12)
- Strict access control (pairing/allowlist)
- Sandboxing for untrusted users
- Session isolation (per-peer scope)
- Disable elevated tools for groups
- Use modern, instruction-hardened models (Opus 4.6 recommended)
- Deny control plane tools in production
- Audit all third-party skills and plugins before installation
- Rotate credentials monthly
- Run in Docker container for process isolation

## Incident Response

### Containment
```bash
# 1. Stop gateway immediately
openclaw gateway stop

# 2. Lock down binding
openclaw config set gateway.bind loopback

# 3. Disable risky channels
openclaw config set channels.slack.dmPolicy disabled
```

### Credential Rotation
```bash
# 1. Rotate gateway token
openclaw config set gateway.auth.token "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

# 2. Rotate remote/provider tokens
# Regenerate API keys via provider dashboards (console.anthropic.com, etc.)

# 3. Re-authenticate channels
openclaw channels logout
openclaw channels login

# 4. Rotate messaging platform tokens (Slack, Telegram, Discord)
# Generate new tokens from each platform's developer portal
```

### Investigation
```bash
# Check gateway logs
cat /tmp/openclaw/openclaw-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log

# Review sessions
ls ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/

# Check config changes
cat ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json

# Full audit
openclaw security audit --deep

# Machine-readable audit output
openclaw security audit --deep --json
```
