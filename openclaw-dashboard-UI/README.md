# OpenClaw Dashboard

A beautiful, zero-dependency command center for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) AI agents.

## Why This Exists

When you run OpenClaw seriously — multiple agents, dozens of cron jobs, sub-agents spawning sub-agents, several Telegram groups and Whatsapp, Slack, and Discord channels, 10+ models, multiple agents and sub-agents — information gets scattered fast.

**The problem:** there was no single place to answer the obvious questions:
- Is my gateway actually running right now?
- How much have I spent today, and which model is burning the most?
- Which cron jobs ran, which failed, and when does the next one fire?
- What sessions are active and how much context are they consuming?
- Are my sub-agents doing useful work or spinning in circles?
- What's the cost trend over the last 7 days — am I accelerating?

The only way to answer these was digging through log files, running CLI commands, and mentally stitching together a picture from 5 different sources. That friction adds up.

**The solution:** a single local page that collects everything in one place — gateway health, costs, cron status, active sessions, sub-agent runs, model usage, git log — refreshed automatically, no login, no cloud, no external dependencies. Open a browser tab, get the full picture in seconds.

It's not trying to replace the OpenClaw CLI or Telegram interface. It's the at-a-glance overview layer that tells you whether everything is healthy and where your money and compute are going — so you can make decisions without hunting for data.

### Custom Themes

Add your own themes by editing `themes.json`. Each theme defines 19 CSS color variables:

```json
{
  "my-theme": {
    "name": "My Theme",
    "type": "dark",
    "icon": "🎯",
    "colors": {
      "bg": "#1a1a2e",
      "surface": "rgba(255,255,255,0.03)",
      "surfaceHover": "rgba(255,255,255,0.045)",
      "border": "rgba(255,255,255,0.06)",
      "accent": "#e94560",
      "accent2": "#0f3460",
      "green": "#4ade80",
      "yellow": "#facc15",
      "red": "#f87171",
      "orange": "#fb923c",
      "purple": "#a78bfa",
      "text": "#e5e5e5",
      "textStrong": "#ffffff",
      "muted": "#737373",
      "dim": "#525252",
      "darker": "#404040",
      "tableBg": "rgba(255,255,255,0.025)",
      "tableHover": "rgba(255,255,255,0.05)",
      "scrollThumb": "rgba(255,255,255,0.1)"
    }
  }
}
```

## Architecture

```
server.py          ← HTTP server + /api/refresh + /api/chat endpoints
  ├── index.html   ← Single-page dashboard (fetches /api/refresh, /api/chat)
  ├── themes.json  ← Theme definitions (user-editable)
  ├── refresh.sh   ← Data collection script (called by server.py)
  └── data.json    ← Generated data (auto-refreshed)
```

When you open the dashboard, `index.html` calls `/api/refresh`. The server runs `refresh.sh` (with 30s debounce) to collect fresh data from your OpenClaw installation, then returns the JSON. No cron jobs needed.

The `/api/chat` endpoint accepts `{"question": "...", "history": [...]}` and forwards a stateless request to the OpenClaw gateway's OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, with a system prompt built from live `data.json`.

### Frontend Module Structure

The entire frontend lives in a single `<script>` tag inside `index.html` — zero dependencies, no build step. The JS is organized into 7 plain objects:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 App.init()                   │
│       (wires everything, starts timer)       │
└───────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬───────┘
        │              │              │
   ┌────▼────┐   ┌─────▼─────┐  ┌────▼─────┐
   │  State  │◄──│ DataLayer │  │  Theme   │
   │ (truth) │   │  (fetch)  │  │ (colors) │
   └────┬────┘   └───────────┘  └──────────┘
        │
   ┌────▼────────────┐
   │  DirtyChecker   │
   │ (what changed?) │
   └────┬────────────┘
        │
   ┌────▼────┐   ┌────────┐
   │Renderer │   │  Chat  │
   │  (DOM)  │   │  (AI)  │
   └─────────┘   └────────┘
```

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| **State** | Single source of truth — holds `data`, `prev`, `tabs`, `countdown`. Produces immutable deep-frozen snapshots for each render cycle. |
| **DataLayer** | Stateless fetch with `_reqId` counter for out-of-order protection. Returns parsed JSON or `null`. |
| **DirtyChecker** | Computes 13 boolean dirty flags by comparing current snapshot against `State.prev`. Uses `stableSnapshot()` to strip volatile timestamps from crons/sessions. |
| **Renderer** | Pure DOM side-effects. Receives frozen snapshot + pre-computed flags, dispatches to 14 section renderers. Owns the agent hierarchy tree, recent-finished buffer, and all chart SVG rendering. |
| **Theme** | Self-contained theme engine — loads `themes.json`, applies CSS variables, persists choice to `localStorage`. |
| **Chat** | AI chat panel — manages history, sends stateless requests to `/api/chat`. |
| **App** | Wiring layer — `init()` starts theme + timer + first fetch; `renderNow()` captures snapshot → computes flags → schedules render via `requestAnimationFrame`; `commitPrev(snap)` runs inside rAF to prevent fetch/paint races. |

All inline `onclick` handlers route through `window.OCUI` — a thin namespace that calls `State.setTab()` / `App.renderNow()`. No bare globals remain outside the module objects and top-level utilities (`$`, `esc`, `safeColor`, `relTime`).

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full specification.

### AI Chat Setup

The chat panel requires:

1. Your OpenClaw gateway running with the `chatCompletions` endpoint enabled:
   ```json
   "gateway": {
     "http": { "endpoints": { "chatCompletions": { "enabled": true } } }
   }
   ```
2. `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` set in your `.env` file (defaults to `~/.openclaw/.env`)

The chat is stateless — each question is sent directly to the gateway with a system prompt built from live `data.json`. No agent memory or tools bleed in.

See [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for full details.

### 🔔 Overview & System Health
Real-time bot status, gateway uptime, memory usage, active session count, today's cost, all-time spend, projected monthly cost, and a per-model cost breakdown donut chart. Smart alert banners surface high costs, failed crons, and context overflows automatically.

![Overview](screenshots/01-overview.png)

---

### 📈 Charts & Trends
Three always-visible SVG charts with 7d/30d toggle: cost trend over time, per-model cost breakdown bars, and sub-agent activity volume. No external chart libraries — pure inline SVG.

![Charts & Trends](screenshots/02-charts-trends.png)

### ⏰ Cron Jobs
All scheduled jobs with status badges (active/idle/error), schedule expression, last run time, next run, duration, and the model used. At-a-glance view of your automation health.

![Cron Jobs](screenshots/03-cron-jobs.png)

---

### 📡 Active Sessions + Agent Hierarchy Tree
Live sessions with model, type badges (DM / group / subagent), context usage %, and token count. Above the session list: a visual agent hierarchy tree showing parent → sub-agent → sub-sub-agent relationships with live/idle status and trigger labels — updated every refresh.

![Active Sessions](screenshots/04-active-sessions.png)

### 📊 Token Usage & Cost
Per-model token and cost breakdown with 7d / 30d / all-time tabs. Includes input tokens, output tokens, cache reads, and total cost per model — sortable at a glance.

![Token Usage](screenshots/05-token-usage.png)

### 🤖 Sub-Agent Activity
All sub-agent runs with cost, duration, status, and token breakdown. Separate 7d/30d tabs. Useful for tracking which tasks spawn the most agents and where spend is concentrated.
